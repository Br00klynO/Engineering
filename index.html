            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br>
            This week we learned about Safety and Etiquette, and did our first challenge. We learned<br>
            that while "in the workshop" it is important to follow S.O.P.s, the standard operating <br>
            procedure. It is also important to make sure you are wearing the correct equipment and <br>
            clothing to be safe. In case of emergency, there are safety features such as the eye wash<br>
            station. After learning about safety, we did a challenge. In the challenge our goal was <br>
            to transport a marble from the starting point to a bucket using only 7 half tubes. To do<br>
            this, we lined up the tubes holding them at slight slopes, and then had everybody who was<br>
            not holding a tube line up in front of the last tube. We would then pass on the tubes when<br>
            the marble had already gone through them. Using this strategy, we were able to get the <br>
            marble to the location of the bucket, we just had trouble actually getting it in. I think<br>
            if we had started off holding our pipes lower, we would have been able to do it.<br>

            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br>
            This week we learned about Safety and Etiquette, and did our first challenge. We learned that while "in the workshop" it is important to follow S.O.P.s, the standard<br>
            operating procedure. It is also important to make sure you are wearing the correct equipment and clothing to be safe. In case of emergency, there are safety features <br>
            such as the eye wash station. After learning about safety, we did a challenge. In the challenge our goal was to transport a marble from the starting point to a bucket <br>
            using only 7 half tubes. To do this, we lined up the tubes holding them at slight slopes, and then had everybody who was not holding a tube line up in front of the last <br>
            tube. We would then pass on the tubes when the marble had already gone through them. Using this strategy, we were able to get the marble to the location of the bucket, <br>
            we just had trouble actually getting it in. I think if we had started off holding our pipes lower, we would have been able to do it.<br>
